    "Architectural innovations in deep learning occur at a breakneck pace, yet fragments of legacy code often persist, carrying assumptions and practices whose necessity remains unquestioned. Practitioners frequently accept these inherited elements as optimal by default, rarely stopping to reevaluate their continued relevance or efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input normalization for convolutional neural networks, particularly in image processing, is a prime example of these unscrutinized practices. This is especially evident in the widespread use of pre-trained models like VGG or ResNet, where specific normalization values have become standard across the community. When consulting AI coding assistants like GitHub's Copilot, it tends to provide the following perspective:\n",
    "\n",
    ">    Image normalization in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has several beneficial effects:\n",
    ">    1- Improved convergence: Normalization helps to stabilize and speed up the learning process by ensuring that pixel values are in a similar range, thus facilitating optimization.\n",
    ">    2- Reduced sensitivity to scale variations: Normalizing images reduces the model's sensitivity to scale variations in pixel values, which can improve model robustness.\n",
    ">    3- Prevention of neuron saturation: Unnormalized pixel values can lead to neuron saturation, which slows down learning. Normalization helps prevent this problem.\n",
    ">    4- Improved performance: In general, image normalization can lead to better model performance in terms of accuracy and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of varying input normalization values on neural network performance warrants closer examination. While conventional wisdom dictates specific normalization parameters for pre-trained models like VGG and ResNet, the fundamental properties of convolutional layers suggest these precise values may be arbitrary. Consider that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The weights in the first convolutional layer are learned parameters\n",
    "2. Convolution kernels can be scaled arbitrarily due to their bias terms\n",
    "3. The current practice of using highly precise three-digit normalization values seems unnecessarily specific\n",
    "\n",
    "This investigation aims to demonstrate quantitatively that the exact normalization values matter less than commonly assumed. The analysis will proceed in two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, examining the classic [LeNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeNet) architecture on the MNIST dataset\n",
    "2. Then, extending the investigation to the more modern [ResNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network) architecture on ImageNet\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach will help validate whether our rigid adherence to specific normalization values is truly justified by empirical evidence.\n",
